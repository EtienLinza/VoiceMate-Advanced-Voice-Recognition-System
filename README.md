## Using VoiceMate

### Registering a Voice
1. Open the application.  
2. Click the "Register New Voice" button.  
3. Enter the name you want to assign to the voice.  
4. Set the recording duration (default is 3 seconds).  
5. Follow the instructions to record the voice.  
6. Once recorded, the profile is saved and ready for detection.

### Detecting a Voice
1. Click the "Detect Voice" button.  
2. Speak into the microphone when prompted.  
3. The system will analyze the voice and display the matching profile name.

### Managing Profiles
- View all saved profiles directly in the application.  
- Add as many profiles as needed for recognition.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Error: `librosa` or another library not found**  
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

- **No sound detected**  
  - Check your microphone and ensure itâ€™s properly connected and enabled.  

- **Voice not recognized**  
  - Ensure the voice was registered with clear and consistent pronunciation.

## How It Works

### Voice Registration
- Records the user's voice as an audio file.  
- Extracts MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from the audio for processing.  
- Saves the features under the specified profile name.

### Voice Detection
- Records a new audio sample and extracts its MFCC features.  
- Uses a trained machine learning model to match the input against registered profiles.  

### Machine Learning
- The system uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.  
- Profiles dynamically update when new voices are added, ensuring up-to-date recognition.

## Tips for Best Results
- Record in a quiet environment to reduce noise.  
- Keep recording durations consistent across profiles for better accuracy.  
- Speak clearly and at a natural pace while registering voices.
